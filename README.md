## 🌍 About The Real Project

TennisMatch is a real-world web application designed to help people find
tennis partners locally.

This project was originally developed in my other GitHub account:\
👉 **[ArturWebDev1](https://github.com/arturwebdev1)**

It was built together with my university teammate (2nd year student,
allCacheDev) over the course of **6 months**.

We went through the entire product lifecycle:

-   📐 Full prototype design in Figma\
-   💻 Frontend development with **Next.js (App Router)**\
-   ⚙️ Backend development with **Spring Boot (Java 21)**\
-   🗄 PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geo features\
-   🚀 Deployment with services like **Render**, **Neon**, **Vercel**,
    **Redis**, **Cloudinary**
-   📱 Production launch

Today, TennisMatch is a **live working application** used in
**California, USA**, helping real people find tennis partners.

We currently have **1000+ registered users**, and I am extremely
grateful that real people are benefiting from something we built.

This is the first project I brought from idea → design → development →
production → real users.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me far more than just coding.

### 🏗 Full Product Development

I participated in:

-   UI/UX design
-   ERD and database design
-   Backend architecture
-   REST + WebSocket implementation
-   Email-based authentication
-   Location + manual geocoding
-   Session + refresh token logic
-   Redis caching
-   Production optimization (512MB instance tuning)
-   Deployment + environment configuration

### 👥 Team Workflow

We worked in a structured task-based system using **Jira**:

Each feature required: - Full technical analysis - Database migrations -
Backend implementation - Frontend integration - Testing - Documentation
update

We practiced an approach similar to **Spec-Driven Development**: After
implementing changes, we updated the documentation to keep the system
clear and AI-friendly.\
This significantly improved focus, reduced ambiguity, and prevented
architectural drift.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters To Me

This was my first real product used by real people.

We talked to users, adjusted features, redesigned flows, improved UX,
and iterated constantly.

Seeing strangers find tennis partners through something we built is the
most rewarding part of my journey so far.
